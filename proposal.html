Here is where we can add the story of our proposal day.

This is a picture of us on the day after the proposal.

<img src="/img/moss.jpg" alt="Mossy Trees" width="500"/>

Here is another image where we aren't in the picture but there is lots of moss and trees.
They are not cropped in this image - if so, that means something is happening that I don't expect.
